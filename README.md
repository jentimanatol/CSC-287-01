# Course Overview  CSC-287!

This course focuses on building object-oriented software applications. It is designed to cover:

1. Language-agnostic fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

2. Language-specific applications of object-oriented programming.

To illustrate the core principles of object-oriented programming, we will specifically focus on **Python**. Python is a widely popular programming language for building large-scale software applications and is increasingly becoming the programming language of choice for data science and machine learning. Besides learning the fundamentals of Python and its OO capabilities, we will focus on using Python with the popular **PyGame**, **Matplotlib**, and **Django** frameworks.

Throughout the semester, you will gain practical skills in Python and practice those skills via multiple programming assignments.

## Official Course Description

This course is for students who already have deep knowledge of an Object-Oriented Language (Advanced Java or Advanced C++). It covers in-depth three of the most commonly requested OOPL in the job market: **C#**, **Visual Basic.NET**, and **Python** (languages covered may change depending on current job market needs). The course will focus on the idiosyncrasies of different new languages. Knowledge of programming structures, the ability to implement lengthy and complex programming solutions, use of debuggers, and adaptability to different IDEs are assumed. Long capstone-like projects will be required for each language examined, and students will be responsible for analyzing and solving problems by applying the good programming practices and styles already learned in prior semesters.

## Prerequisites

- Grade of C or better in Advanced Java Programming (CIT285) or Advanced C++ (CIT284)
- Precalculus (MAT197)

## Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should feel comfortable demonstrating the following materials, concepts, and techniques of Object-Oriented Programming by creating working computer programs:

- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes
- Inheritance
- Data Abstraction
- Aggregation vs. Composition in Class Design
- Interfaces
- Use of language libraries to enhance programs
- Basic Design Patterns
- Create and utilize UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to outline classes
- Create and utilize Use Case Diagrams as part of a program specification
- Creation and use of detailed program requirements specifications

## Procedures and Objectives

- Lecture and group discussions
- Readings for class from texts, online resources, and other related materials
- Hands-on participative exercises
