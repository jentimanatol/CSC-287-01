# 2024FA OOPL for Programmers (CSC-287-01)

This is a course in building object-oriented software applications.  It is designed to cover:  1) language-agnostic fundamentals of object-oriented programming; and 2) language-specific applications of object-oriented programming.

To illustrate the core principles of object-oriented programming, we will
specifically focus on Python. Python  is a widely popular programming language for building large-scale software  applications, and increasingly the programming  language of choice for data science and machine learning. Besides learning the fundamentals  of  Python, and its OO capabilities, we will focus on using Python with the popular PyGame, Matplotlib, and Django frameworks.

Throughout the semester, you will gain practical skills in Python, and practice those skills via multiple programming assignments.

# OFFICIAL COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
This course is for students who already have deep knowledge of an Object-Oriented Language (Advanced Java or Advance C++). This course will cover in depth three of the most commonly requested OOPL in the job market, C#, Visual Basic.NET and Python (languages covered may change depending on the current job market needs). The course will focus on the idiosyncrasies of the different new languages. Knowledge of programming structures and ability to implement lengthy and complex programming solutions, use of the debuggers and ease to adapt in different IDEs is assumed. Long capstone-like projects will be required for each language examined and students will be responsible to analyze and solve the problems by applying the good programming practices and styles already learned in prior semesters.

# PREREQUISITES:
 Grade of C or better in Advanced Java programming (CIT285) or Advanced C++ (CIT284), and Precalculus (MAT197).

# STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
Upon completion of this course students should know and feel comfortable demonstrating the following material, concepts, and techniques of Object-Oriented Programming by creating working computer programs:

Encapsulation

Polymorphism

Abstract Classes

Inheritance

Data Abstraction

Aggregation vs. Composition in Class Design

Interfaces

Use of language libraries to enhance programs

Basic Design Patterns

Create and utilize UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to outline classes

Create and utilize Use Case Diagrams as part of a program specification

Creation and use of detailed program requirements specifications

# PROCEDURES AND OBJECTIVES: 
 Lecture and group discussions, readings for class from texts, online resources, and other related materials, hands-on participative exercises.
