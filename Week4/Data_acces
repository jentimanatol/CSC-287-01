first_name, last_name, and social_security_number.

Create a Person object, and access the public properties.
Now, modify these properties to use underscore, e.g. _first_name, _last_name, 
and _social_security_number.
Create another Person object.  Are you still able to access the protected variables? 
Do you get PyLint warnings?
